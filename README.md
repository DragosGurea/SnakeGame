# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic video game where the player controls a snake on a bordered plane. The objective is to eat food items that appear on the screen while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the boundaries of the playing area.

## Gameplay

- The game starts with a snake consisting of a single segment, and the player can control the snake's movement using arrow keys or other specified controls.
- As the snake moves, it leaves a trail behind, and the player must navigate the snake to eat the food items that randomly appear on the screen.
- When the snake eats a food item, it grows longer by adding a new segment to its tail.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the playing area or with its own body.
- The player's objective is to achieve the highest possible score by eating as much food as possible without colliding with obstacles.

## Features

The Snake Game includes the following features:

- *Score tracking:* The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats a food item.
- *Speed adjustment:* The game speed can be adjusted to make it more challenging or easier, depending on the player's preference.
- *Obstacles:* The game can include obstacles that the player must avoid, such as walls or other stationary objects.
- *Power-ups:* Power-up items can appear on the screen, providing temporary benefits to the player, such as increased speed or invincibility.
- *Game over screen:* When the game ends, a game over screen is displayed, showing the player's final score and providing options to restart the game or exit.

## Technologies Used

The Snake Game is typically implemented using various technologies and frameworks, such as:

- *Programming language:* The game logic is written in a programming language like Python, JavaScript, or C++.
- *Graphics library:* A graphics library like Pygame, HTML5 Canvas, or OpenGL is used to render the game graphics and handle user input.
- *Data structures:* Data structures like arrays, linked lists, or grids are used to represent the snake's body, food items, and obstacles.
- *Collision detection:* Algorithms for collision detection are employed to check for collisions between the snake and other objects.
- *Game loop:* A game loop is used to continuously update the game state, handle user input, and render the graphics.
